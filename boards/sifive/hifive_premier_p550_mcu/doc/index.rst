Supported Features
==================

.. zephyr:board-supported-hw::

System Clock
============

The System Clock could be driven by internal or external oscillator,
as well as main PLL clock. By default System clock is driven by PLL clock
at 168MHz, driven by 8MHz high speed external clock.

Serial Port
===========

The Zephyr console output is assigned to UART1. Default settings are 115200 8N1.

Programming and Debugging
*************************

.. zephyr:board-supported-runners::

Applications for the ``hifive_premier_p550_mcu`` board configuration can be built and
flashed in the usual way (see :ref:`build_an_application` and
:ref:`application_run` for more details).

Flashing
========

SiFive HiFive Premier board includes an ST-LINK/V2 embedded debug tool interface.
This interface is supported by the openocd version included in Zephyr SDK.

Flashing an application to SiFive HiFive Premier STM32
------------------------------------------------------

Here is an example for the :zephyr:code-sample:`blinky` application.

Build and flash the application:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/basic/blinky
   :board: hifive_premier_p550_mcu
   :goals: build flash

Debugging
=========

You can debug an application in the usual way.  Here is an example for the
:zephyr:code-sample:`hello_world` application.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/hello_world
   :board: hifive_premier_p550_mcu
   :maybe-skip-config:
   :goals: debug
